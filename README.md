# 🧠 Streamlit ML Model Deployment 

This repository contains the implementation of a web application built using **Streamlit** that deploys a trained **Machine Learning model**. The application allows users to input custom data, generate predictions, and understand the model's behavior through intuitive visualizations.

## 📌 Assignment Objective

**Goal:**  
Develop an interactive web application using **Streamlit** to deploy a trained ML model. The app should:

- Accept user inputs for prediction.
- Display prediction results instantly.
- Include visualizations to help users interpret model outputs.

This task is aimed at helping you learn how to make your machine learning projects **accessible**, **interactive**, and **user-friendly**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Streamlit-powered web interface  
- 📈 Real-time predictions from a trained model  
- 📊 Visualization of input data and model behavior  
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and transformation pipeline  
- 🛠 Modular and clean code for ease of understanding

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
